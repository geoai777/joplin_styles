# Joplin app styles

First things first
## File location
Location of `userstyle.css` can be found in `Tools->Options->General` 
```
Notes and settings are stored in: C:\Users\User\.config\joplin-desktop
```
By default there is no file `userstyle.css`, so you need to created it.

## Run and run
All you need is to create your own style and **restart application**. 
*Hint: Custom style is coped to temp on applicaton startup, so is main joplin style. This means you can see current style used in `C:\Users\User\.config\joplin-desktop\tmp` (in my case, your actual path may differ, see above).
